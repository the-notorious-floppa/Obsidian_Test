The role of ruling parties in providing institutional mechanisms of stability through a more effective spoils allocation and encouraging elite cooperation. Trying to explain the variation in the durability of single-party authoritarian regimes.

Examining differences in institutional strength. A Huntingtonian question: where do strong parties, or single party regimes, come from? Using historical institutionalism to answer this question.

Party-state complexes are products not so much of institutional design as periods of violent conflict and struggle.

### The Historical Roots of Durable Authoritarianism: Revolutionary and Counter-Revolutionary Paths

Stable authoritarian regimes are based not so much on ruling parties as the party-state complexes.

Limiting elite defection. Pre-empt opposition and crackdown on mobilization in the bud. Tight partisan control over armed forces.

<aside> 💡 Indeed, an examination of (non-monarchic) authoritarian regimes that survived for 50 years or more (e.g., China, Cuba, Malaysia, Mexico, Singapore, Soviet Union, Taiwan, Vietnam) reveals a striking pattern: nearly all of them were based on a party-state complex whose origins lie in periods of extended and violent conflict. As Huntington (1970, 13–14) noted decades ago, the most stable single party regimes have been a “product of struggle and violence.”

</aside>

Violent conflicts gave rise to institutional legacies that led to the formation of durable authoritarian regimes. Apart from revolution and counter-revolution, durable authoritarian regimes were also produced through dynastic monarchies.

### A Revolutionary Path

Huntington famously argued that durable single party regimes were often “the product of nationalist or revolutionary movements from below which had to fight for power.”

So, durability and stability cannot be designed or imposed from above: it needs to evolve from below. Perhaps we can use this as a criteria of stability: democracies that are imposed and not evolved are also very unstable. In other words, stability depends on how ‘institutions’ came to emerge.

Revolutions, according to Huntington, strengthen state and party structures, create disciplined ruling elites, and facilitate the elimination of political rivals.

Seizure of power leads to reaction either from the military or external threats, reinforcing elite cohesion.

Selection bias?

> Regimes that survive these initial sequences tend to be strikingly durable in their aftermath.

### Revolutionary Struggle and the Seizure of Power

Revolutionary struggle produces strong ruling parties. Liberation struggles — extensive mass organizations and cohesive party structures.

Seen from another perspective, revolutions unite people, imbue them with a belief in a common ideal worth sacrificing their individual interests for, a kind of republican virtue; ideological cohesion (like Barry Weingast on the importance of believing in democracy) is essential to stability. Uniting against a common enemy: polarization in the US increased after the fall of the USSR. Investing something of your own into the enterprise makes you more likely to support it — which is why support for the Soviet regime begin to wave as new generations came to dominate: the population supported Stalin in spite of all his flaws because they endured a war under him he helped win.

> As Adrienne LeBas (2011) argues, intense polarization sharpens “us-them” distinctions, strengthens within-group ties, and fosters perceptions of a “linked fate” among cadres.

<aside> 💡 When the opposition can be credibly linked to historic enemies against which the revolutionaries fought a life and death struggle, and where abandoning the ruling party can therefore be viewed as treason, the cost of defection will be high.

</aside>

The army and security forces are rebuilt anew, which makes them loyal to the prevailing ideology.

### Counter-Revolution, War, and Authoritarian Consolidation

> As Jack Goldstone observes, “far more violence is committed by new revolutionary regimes after seizing power—in order to consolidate their control of society, or in civil wars between revolutionaries and counter-revolutionaries—than is committed by revolutionary actors against authorities before the latter are overthrown.”

Regimes that survived civil strife or military conflict tend to emerge strengthened thanks to

-   enhanced coercive apparatus of the state; former revolutionary combatants are then placed into the security apparatus, leading to the formation of revolutionary garrison states;
-   consolidation of ruling parties; discipline and obedience of the Bolsheviks;
-   destruction of alternative centers of power;

<aside> 💡 The destruction of traditional rulers, established churches, landowning classes, and other organized political forces contributes to authoritarian durability by eliminating not only contemporary rivals but also the structural bases of future opposition. In the absence of independent sources of finance, infrastructure, and/or legitimacy, the organizational bases of opposition effectively disappear.

</aside>

The result is a regime that is nearly invulnerable to military coups (Adelman 1982), less prone to elite defection (Levitsky and Way 2012), and well-equipped to survive economic crises and thwart opposition protest (Huntington 1968, 309–310).

<aside> 💡 Yet ten of the twelve revolutionary authoritarian regimes that existed in (p. 215) January 1989 survived through 2014, compared to barely a third (29 of 82) of the world’s non-revolutionary authoritarian regimes.

</aside>

### A Counter-Revolutionary Path

> Thus, it is only where radical protest or insurgency afflicted urban areas and triggered communal violence during the post-colonial period that elites accede to “protection pacts” in which they pay higher taxes and finance ruling parties in exchange for order and security.

<aside> 💡 For Slater, then, durable counter-revolutionary Leviathans emerged where endemic, unmanageable conflict threatened elites prior to the establishment of authoritarian rule.

</aside>

Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, and perhaps also Taiwan and South Africa. Greater tax revenue allowed autocrats to consolidate their power and conserve societal stability.

Less threatening politics — less authoritarian consolidation (Malaysia vs the Philippines). Authoritarian rule was built on a weaker state.

> The South Vietnamese case thus highlights the path dependent character of Slater’s argument: only where an endemic, unmanageable threat led to a protection pact before the (p. 217) establishment of postwar authoritarian regimes do we see the development of the powerful party-state complex that underlies durable authoritarianism.

In other words, autocrats cannot rule on their own — they need to rely either on popular support, elites, coercion, or a combination of both to survive.

### Mechanisms of Authoritarian Reproduction

Historical institutionalism therefore highlights the importance of timing and sequencing in determining the long-term trajectories of authoritarian regimes.

The challenge: determining how and why institutions persist or expire — though some do generate self-reinforcing dynamics. The power of founding legacies.

Early electoral dominance may induce greater success through power propaganda (Haifen Huang), which encourages political opponents to leave political arena.

In a way, this applies to democracies too. Americans experienced a civil war, and for many years, this has had a positive impact on their perception of democracy, its value etc.

<aside> 💡 Once the founding generation passes from the scene, revolutionary cohesion dissipates (Levitsky and Way 2013, 13–14)... Hence, although revolutionary legacies may be quite powerful, they weaken with the departure of the founding generation.

</aside>

> Regime elites must actively work to reproduce elite fears of unrest (Slater 2010, 20)... The question of regimes’ capacity to adapt over time, and the potential sources of such adaptive capacity, is a crucial one for future research.

Power resides where men believe it resides, and when people cease to believe in the legitimacy of the regime, it no longer has power over them.
